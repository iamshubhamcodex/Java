	/**
	 *	Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.
	 * 
	 * 	Git is DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM. So Git does not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a projext's files.
	 *  Instead, every user "clones" a copy of a repository(a collection of files) and has the full history off the project on their own hard drive.
	 * 
	 *  This clone has all of the metadata of the original while the original itself is stored on a self-hosted server or a third party hosting service 
	 *  like GitHub.
